This means we will sample a value `x` from `[log(1), log(10^5)]` and then transform it back to the original scale using `exp(x)`.\n\n2. **Uniform Sampling**: We use `numpy`'s `random.uniform` function to sample a value uniformly from the logarithmic range.\n\n3. **Exponentiation**: After sampling, we exponentiate the sampled value to get it back to the original scale.\n\n4. **Rounding**: Since `n` must be an integer, we round the sampled value to the nearest integer.\n\n5. **Clipping**: We ensure that the final value of `n` is within the valid range `[1, 10^5]`.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `generate` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate():\n    # Sample a value uniformly on a logarithmic scale\n    log_min = np.log(1)\n    log_max = np.log(10**5)\n    log_sample = np.random.uniform(log_min, log_max)\n    \n    # Transform the sampled value back to the original scale\n    n = np.exp(log_sample)\n    \n    # Round to the nearest integer\n    n = round(n)\n    \n    # Ensure n is within the valid range\n    n = max(1, min(n, 10**5))\n    \n    return n\n```\n\nThis function will generate a single random integer `n` each time it is called, following the specified constraints and ensuring a uniform distribution on a logarithmic scale.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nFor the given problem, the task is to return the number of '1's in the first `n` numbers of the magical string `s`.

This range is specified in the constraints.\n\n3. **Return the Generated List**: The function should return a single list of integers that adheres to the above constraints.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `generate()` function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef generate():\n    # Step 1: Generate a random length for the list on a logarithmic scale\n    min_length = 1\n    max_length = 2000\n    log_min_length = math.log(min_length)\n    log_max_length = math.log(max_length)\n    log_length = random.uniform(log_min_length, log_max_length)\n    length = int(round(math.exp(log_length)))\n    \n    # Step 2: Generate a list of random integers within the specified range\n    min_value = -10**6\n    max_value = 10**6\n    nums = [random.randint(min_value, max_value) for _ in range(length)]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the generated list\n    return nums\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Logarithmic Sampling**: We use `math.log` to transform the range of possible lengths into a logarithmic scale. This allows us to sample lengths uniformly in this transformed space, which corresponds to a non-uniform distribution in the original space, covering a wide range of lengths effectively.\n- **Random Integer Generation**: We use `random.randint` to generate each integer in the list within the specified range of -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.\n- **Return**: The function returns a single list of integers that can be used as input for the target function.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nThe problem statement asks for the number of longest increasing subsequences. The output is a single integer representing the count of such subsequences. Since the output is a single integer, the order does not matter. Therefore, the answer is order-independent.\n\n`<flag>Order-independent</flag>`\n\n### **Task 2: Generate a Boolean Comparison Function**\n\nSince the answer is order-independent and is a single integer, the comparison function can simply check for equality.\n\n```python\ndef compare(user_output, expected_output):\n    return user_output == expected_output\n```", "guess_func": "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of longest increasing subsequences in the given array `nums`.\n2. **Simplify the Problem**: Instead of finding the actual longest increasing subsequences, we can guess the answer.\n3. **Guessing Strategy**: Since the problem asks for the number of longest increasing subsequences, and we need to prefer guessing that no solution exists, we can simply return 0.\n4. **Edge Cases**: If the array is empty, there are no subsequences, so returning 0 makes sense.\n5. **General Case**: For any non-empty array, we guess that there are no longest increasing subsequences, which aligns with the preference to guess no solution exists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef guess(nums):\n    # Guess that no solution exists\n    return 0\n```\n\nThis function always returns 0, which is a simple and valid guess according to the problem's requirements.", "idx": 409}

If $\\textit{limit}$ is true, then $\\textit{up}$ is the digit corresponding to $s[i]$. Otherwise, $\\textit{up}$ is $9$.\nThen, we enumerate the current digit $j$ in the range $[0, \\textit{up}]$.

This approach helps in covering a wide range of input sizes effectively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement the `generate` function:\n\n1. **Logarithmic Sampling**: Since the range is from 1 to \\(10^9\\), we can use logarithmic sampling to ensure that we cover a wide range of values.

So we can divide the array into three parts, the first part is the root node, the second part is the elements of the left subtree, denoted as $left$, and the third part is the elements of the right subtree, denoted as $right$.

We can choose $m$ positions from $m + n$ positions in array $nums$ to place the elements of the left subtree, and the remaining $n$ positions to place the elements of the right subtree, so that we can ensure that the reordered binary search tree is the same as the original array $nums$. Therefore, the calculation method of $dfs(nums)$ is:\n$$\ndfs(nums) = C_{m+n}^m \\times dfs(left) \\times dfs(right)\n$$\nwhere $C_{m+n}^m$ represents the number of schemes to select $m$ positions from $m + n$ positions, which we can get through preprocessing.\nNote the modulo operation of the answer, because the value of $dfs(nums)$ may be very large, so we need to take the modulo of each step in the calculation process, and finally take the modulo of the entire result.", "problem": "Given an array nums that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

Therefore, the order of the elements in the `answer` array is significant.\n\nThus, the answer should be **order-dependent**.\n\n### **Task 2: Generate a Boolean Comparison Function**\n\nSince the answer is order-dependent, the comparison function should compare the outputs strictly as given.\n\nHere is the `compare` function:\n\n```python\ndef compare(user_output, expected_output):\n    return user_output == expected_output\n```\n\nThis function will return `True` if `user_output` and `expected_output` are exactly the same, including the order of elements, and `False` otherwise.", "guess_func": "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find a non-negative integer `k` such that the XOR of all elements in the array `nums` and `k` is maximized. This needs to be done for each query, and after each query, the last element of `nums` is removed.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - `k` must be less than `2^maximumBit`.\n   - The array `nums` is sorted and contains non-negative integers.\n\n3. **Maximizing XOR**: To maximize the XOR result, `k` should ideally flip all the bits of the XOR of all elements in `nums` that are less than `2^maximumBit`.\n\n4. **Simplification**: \n   - Since the problem asks for the simplest possible function, we can guess that no solution exists or return a hardcoded value.\n   - Given the constraints and the nature of XOR, a simple guess could be to return an array of zeros, which is a valid `k` but does not necessarily maximize the XOR.\n\n5. **Prefer No Solution**: Since the problem suggests to prefer guessing that no solution exists, we can return an empty array or a specific value indicating no solution.\n\n### Simplest Possible Function\n\nGiven the instructions, the simplest function that prefers guessing no solution exists would be to return an empty array.\n\n```python\ndef guess(nums, maximumBit):\n    # Guessing that no solution exists\n    return []\n```\n\nThis function does not attempt to compute the actual values of `k` and instead opts for the simplest approach of indicating no solution.", "idx": 1205}

Since the range is from 0 to \\(2^{31} - 1\\), we will use logarithmic sampling to ensure a uniform distribution over the possible values.\n   - We will use the `numpy` library to help with logarithmic sampling.\n\n3. **Generate Random Values**:\n   - We will generate random values for `memory1` and `memory2` using logarithmic sampling.\n   - We need to ensure that the generated values are within the specified range.\n\n4. **Return the Generated Values**:\n   - The function should return a tuple `(memory1, memory2)` which can be directly used as input to the target function.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `generate` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate():\n    # Define the range for memory1 and memory2\n    min_val = 0\n    max_val = 2**31 - 1\n    \n    # Generate random values on a logarithmic scale\n    log_min = np.log(min_val + 1)  # log(1) to avoid log(0)\n    log_max = np.log(max_val + 1)\n    \n    # Sample uniformly in the log space\n    log_memory1 = np.random.uniform(log_min, log_max)\n    log_memory2 = np.random.uniform(log_min, log_max)\n    \n    # Convert back to the original scale\n    memory1 = int(np.exp(log_memory1) - 1)\n    memory2 = int(np.exp(log_memory2) - 1)\n    \n    # Ensure the values are within the valid range\n    memory1 = max(min_val, min(max_val, memory1))\n    memory2 = max(min_val, min(max_val, memory2))\n    \n    return (memory1, memory2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Logarithmic Sampling**: We use `np.log` to transform the range into a logarithmic scale, ensuring that smaller values are more likely to be sampled.\n- **Uniform Sampling**: We use `np.random.uniform` to sample uniformly in the logarithmic space.\n- **Exponential Transformation**: We use `np.exp` to transform the sampled values back to the original scale.\n- **Range Clamping**: We ensure that the generated values are within the valid range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.\n\nThis function will generate a single random sample of `(memory1, memory2)` each time it is called, which can be used as input to the target function.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nThe problem requires returning an array containing `[crashTime, memory1crash, memory2crash]`.

However, in this specific problem, we are only generating a single integer `finalSum`, so we need to ensure that this integer is sampled logarithmically within the range [2, \\(10^{10}\\)] (since 1 is not even).\n\n3. **Generate Even Numbers**: Since `finalSum` must be even, we will generate numbers in the form of `2 * x`, where `x` is sampled logarithmically in the range [1, \\(5 \\times 10^9\\)].\n\n4. **Return the Generated Number**: Each call to `generate()` should return a single even number within the specified range.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `generate()` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport random\n\ndef generate():\n    # Define the range for x such that 2 * x is within [2, 10^10]\n    min_x = 1\n    max_x = 5 * 10**9\n    \n    # Sample x logarithmically\n    log_min_x = math.log(min_x)\n    log_max_x = math.log(max_x)\n    log_x = random.uniform(log_min_x, log_max_x)\n    x = math.exp(log_x)\n    \n    # Convert x to an integer and ensure it's even\n    finalSum = 2 * round(x)\n    \n    return finalSum\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Logarithmic Sampling**: We use `math.log` to transform the range [1, \\(5 \\times 10^9\\)] to a logarithmic scale, sample a value uniformly in this transformed range, and then use `math.exp` to convert it back to the original scale.\n- **Ensure Even Number**: By multiplying the sampled `x` by 2 and rounding it, we ensure that `finalSum` is always an even number.\n- **Return the Value**: The function returns a single even number within the specified range, which can be used as input for the target function.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the integers in the returned list can be in any order. Therefore, the answer should be considered **order-independent**.\n\n`<flag>Order-independent</flag>`\n\n### **Task 2: Generate a Boolean Comparison Function**\n\nBased on the result of Task 1, the comparison function should compare the outputs while ignoring order. Here is the `compare` function:\n\n```python\ndef compare(user_output, expected_output):\n    return set(user_output) == set(expected_output)\n```\n\nThis function converts both `user_output` and `expected_output` to sets and compares them, which effectively ignores the order of elements.", "guess_func": "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to split a given integer `finalSum` into the maximum number of unique positive even integers. If it's not possible, we should return an empty list.\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - If `finalSum` is odd, it's impossible to split it into even integers, so we should return an empty list.\n   - If `finalSum` is even, we can try to split it into the smallest possible unique even integers (2, 4, 6, ...).\n\n3. **Simplification**:\n   - Since the problem asks for the simplest possible function, we can use a hardcoded approach for small values of `finalSum` and return an empty list for others.\n   - We can also use a simple greedy approach to try and split the number, but for simplicity, we'll stick to hardcoded solutions.\n\n4. **Hardcoded Solutions**:\n   - For `finalSum = 2`, the only solution is `[2]`.\n   - For `finalSum = 4`, the only solution is `[4]`.\n   - For `finalSum = 6`, the only solution is `[2, 4]`.\n   - For `finalSum = 8`, the only solution is `[2, 6]` or `[4, 4]` (but since 4 is repeated, we use `[2, 6]`).\n   - For `finalSum = 10`, the only solution is `[2, 4, 6]`.\n   - For `finalSum = 12`, the only solution is `[2, 4, 6]` (same as 10, but we can also use `[2, 10]`).\n\n5. **General Case**:\n   - For any other even `finalSum`, we can return an empty list as a simple guess.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef guess(finalSum):\n    # Hardcoded solutions for small values of finalSum\n    if finalSum == 2:\n        return [2]\n    elif finalSum == 4:\n        return [4]\n    elif finalSum == 6:\n        return [2, 4]\n    elif finalSum == 8:\n        return [2, 6]\n    elif finalSum == 10:\n        return [2, 4, 6]\n    elif finalSum == 12:\n        return [2, 4, 6]\n    \n    # For any other even finalSum, guess no solution exists\n    return []\n```\n\nThis function provides a simple and hardcoded approach to solving the problem for a few specific cases and guesses no solution exists for other even numbers.", "idx": 1465}

This is a valid approach since the problem constraints and the nature of card placement make it unlikely that many values of `n` will yield a solution.\n\n3. **Hardcode Known Solutions**: For very small values of `n`, we can hardcode the known solutions. For example, `n = 2` can form one triangle, and `n = 7` can form a simple two-row house of cards.\n\n4. **Default to No Solution**: For all other values of `n`, we will guess that no solution exists.

This can be achieved by adjusting the dimensions if their product exceeds the limit.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `generate` function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef generate():\n    # Sample m and n on a logarithmic scale\n    log_m = random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(100000))\n    log_n = random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(100000))\n    \n    m = int(round(math.exp(log_m)))\n    n = int(round(math.exp(log_n)))\n    \n    # Adjust m and n to ensure m * n <= 10^5\n    while m * n > 100000:\n        if m > n:\n            m = int(round(math.exp(random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(100000 / n)))))\n        else:\n            n = int(round(math.exp(random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(100000 / m)))))\n    \n    # Generate the grid with random values between 1 and 1000\n    grid = [[random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]\n    \n    return grid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Logarithmic Sampling**: We use `random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(100000))` to sample `m` and `n` on a logarithmic scale. This ensures that the values are uniformly distributed over the logarithmic range.\n- **Adjusting Dimensions**: If the product `m * n` exceeds 100000, we adjust one of the dimensions to ensure the product constraint is met.\n- **Grid Generation**: We fill the grid with random integers between 1 and 1000 using `random.randint(1, 1000)`.\n\nThis function will generate a single random grid that matches the input format and constraints of the target function.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nFor the given problem, the task is to find the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path in a grid.

A cornered path can have at most one turn.\n\n2. **Trailing Zeros**: Trailing zeros in a number are produced by factors of 10, which are the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, to maximize trailing zeros, we need to maximize the minimum count of factors of 2 and 5 in the product.\n\n3. **Simplification**: Instead of calculating the exact maximum number of trailing zeros, we can guess that no such path exists or return a hardcoded value that is likely to be the answer for many test cases.\n\n4. **Guessing the Answer**: Since the problem asks us to prefer guessing that no solution exists, we can return 0, which implies that no path can produce any trailing zeros.

The conditions are related to the composition of the numbers rather than their size, so we can use the concept of Digit DP to solve it. In Digit DP, the size of the number has little impact on the complexity.\nFor the range $[l, ..r]$ problem, we generally convert it to the problem of $[1, ..r]$ and then subtract the result of $[1, ..l - 1]$, i.e.:\n$$\nans = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} ans_i -  \\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} ans_i\n$$\nHowever, for this problem, we only need to find the value for the range $[1, ..n]$.\nHere, we use memoized search to implement Digit DP. We search from the starting point downwards, and at the lowest level, we get the number of solutions. We then return the answers layer by layer upwards, and finally get the final answer from the starting point of the search.\nBased on the problem information, we design a function $\\textit{dfs}(i, \\textit{mask}, \\textit{lead}, \\textit{limit})$, where:\n-   The digit $i$ represents the current position being searched, starting from the highest digit, i.e., $i = 0$ represents the highest digit.\n-   The digit $\\textit{mask}$ represents the current state of the number, i.e., the $j$-th bit of $\\textit{mask}$ being $1$ indicates that the digit $j$ has been used.\n-   The boolean $\\textit{lead}$ indicates whether the current number only contains leading $0$s.\n-   The boolean $\\textit{limit}$ indicates whether the current number is restricted by the upper bound.\nThe function executes as follows:\nIf $i$ exceeds the length of the number $n$, it means the search is over.

Otherwise, return $1$.\nIf $\\textit{limit}$ is false and $\\textit{lead}$ is false and the state of $\\textit{mask}$ has been memoized, directly return the memoized result.\nOtherwise, we calculate the current upper bound $up$. If $\\textit{limit}$ is true, $up$ is the $i$-th digit of the current number. Otherwise, $up = 9$.\nThen we iterate over $[0, up]$. For each digit $j$, if the $j$-th bit of $\\textit{mask}$ is $1$, it means the digit $j$ has been used, so we skip it. Otherwise, if $\\textit{lead}$ is true and $j = 0$, it means the current number only contains leading $0$s, so we recursively search the next digit. Otherwise, we recursively search the next digit and update the state of $\\textit{mask}$.\nFinally, if $\\textit{limit}$ is false and $\\textit{lead}$ is false, memoize the current state.\nReturn the final answer.\nThe time complexity is $O(m \\times 2^D \\times D)$, and the space complexity is $O(m \\times 2^D)$.

We can use a uniform distribution to sample these values.\n\n3. **Return the Generated Array**: The function should return a single array that meets the above criteria.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `generate()` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport random\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef generate() -> List[int]:\n    # Step 1: Sample the length of the array on a logarithmic scale\n    log_min = math.log(1)\n    log_max = math.log(1000)\n    log_length = random.uniform(log_min, log_max)\n    length = int(round(math.exp(log_length)))\n    \n    # Step 2: Generate the array elements\n    nums = [random.randint(1, 2000) for _ in range(length)]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the generated array\n    return nums\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Logarithmic Sampling for Length**: We use `math.log` to transform the range [1, 1000] into a logarithmic scale. We then sample a random value in this transformed range and convert it back using `math.exp` to get the actual length.\n- **Generating Elements**: We use `random.randint(1, 2000)` to generate each element of the array, ensuring that each element is a positive integer within the specified range.\n- **Returning the Array**: Finally, the generated array is returned, which can be used as input to the target function.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nLet's analyze the problem statement. The task is to return the number of complete subarrays. The number of complete subarrays is a single integer value, not a list, set, or any collection of elements. Therefore, the order does not matter in the context of the final output, which is a single integer.\n\nHowever, the problem involves identifying subarrays, and the order of elements within those subarrays does matter.

This is essentially the length of the path between these two points, minus the number of times the most frequently occurring edge appears on the path.\nThe length of the path between two points can be obtained by finding the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) using binary lifting. Let's denote the two points as $u$ and $v$, and their LCA as $x$. Then, the path length from $u$ to $v$ is $depth(u) + depth(v) - 2 \\times depth(x)$.\nAdditionally, we can use an array $cnt[n][26]$ to record the number of occurrences of each edge weight from the root node to each node. Then, the number of times the most frequently occurring edge appears on the path from $u$ to $v$ is $\\max_{0 \\leq j < 26} cnt[u][j] + cnt[v][j] - 2 \\times cnt[x][j]$, where $x$ is the LCA of $u$ and $v$.\nThe process of finding the LCA using binary lifting is as follows:\nWe denote the depth of each node as $depth$, its parent node as $p$, and $f[i][j]$ as the $2^j$th ancestor of node $i$. Then, for any two points $x$ and $y$, we can find their LCA as follows:\n1. If $depth(x) < depth(y)$, then swap $x$ and $y$, i.e., ensure that the depth of $x$ is not less than the depth of $y$;\n2.

We then convert this back to the linear space to get the value of `k`.\n3. **Return the Sample**: The generated `k` value is returned as the test data.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `generate()` function:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\ndef generate():\n    # Generate a random number in the logarithmic space between log(1) and log(10^5)\n    log_k = random.uniform(math.log(1), math.log(10**5))\n    # Convert the logarithmic value back to the linear space\n    k = int(math.exp(log_k))\n    # Ensure k is within the valid range [1, 10^5]\n    k = max(1, min(k, 10**5))\n    return k\n```\n\nThis function will generate a single random integer `k` each time it is called, ensuring that `k` is uniformly distributed on a logarithmic scale within the specified range.", "compare_func": "### **Task 1: Determine if the answer should be \"order-independent\"**\n\nFor the given problem, the task is to return a single integer representing the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of elements of the final array greater than or equal to `k`. Since the output is a single integer, the order does not matter. Therefore, the answer is **order-independent**.\n\nOutput: `\"<flag>Order-independent</flag>\"`\n\n### **Task 2: Generate a Boolean Comparison Function**\n\nSince the answer is order-independent and is a single integer, the comparison function will simply check if the user's output is equal to the expected output.\n\nHere is the `compare` function:\n\n```python\ndef compare(user_output, expected_output):\n    return user_output == expected_output\n```\n\nThis function will return `True` if the user's output matches the expected output, and `False` otherwise.", "guess_func": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with an array `nums = [1]`, so the initial sum is `1`.\n2. **Objective**: We need to make the sum of the array elements `>= k` using the minimum number of operations.\n3. **Operations**:\n   - **Increment**: Increase any element by 1.\n   - **Duplicate**: Duplicate any element and add it to the end of the array.\n4. **Simplification**:\n   - The simplest way to increase the sum is to duplicate the existing elements and then increment them if necessary.\n   - However, for the sake of simplicity in guessing, we can assume that duplicating the initial `1` and incrementing it might be sufficient.\n5. **Guessing Strategy**:\n   - If `k` is very small (e.g., `k = 1`), no operations are needed.\n   - For larger `k`, we can guess that duplicating the initial `1` and incrementing it might be enough, but if `k` is too large, we might guess that no simple solution exists.\n6. **Hardcoding**:\n   - We can hardcode a few small values of `k` and guess for larger values.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef guess(k):\n    # Hardcoded guesses for small values of k\n    if k == 1:\n        return 0\n    if k == 2:\n        return 1\n    if k == 3:\n        return 2\n    if k == 4:\n        return 3\n    # For larger k, guess that no simple solution exists\n    return -1\n```\n\nThis function provides a simple guess for the minimum number of operations required.

As $x$ increases, there will be more and more numbers less than or equal to $x$.

We achieve this through the function $\\text{check}(mx)$.\nThe implementation idea of the function $\\text{check}(mx)$ is as follows:\nSince the longer the subarray, the more different elements it contains, we can use two pointers to maintain a sliding window such that the number of different elements in the window does not exceed $mx$.

For each $r$, we add $\\textit{nums}[r]$ to the window and update $\\textit{cnt}[\\textit{nums}[r]]$. If the number of different elements in the window exceeds $mx$, we need to move $l$ to the right until the number of different elements in the window does not exceed $mx$. At this point, the subarrays with the right endpoint $r$ and left endpoints in the range $[l, .., r]$ all meet the condition, and there are $r - l + 1$ such subarrays.

Therefore, the answer is **order-dependent**.\n\n**Output:**\n`<flag>Order-dependent</flag>`\n\n### **Task 2: Generate a Boolean Comparison Function**\n\nSince the answer is order-dependent, the comparison function should compare the outputs strictly as given.\n\nHere is the `compare` function:\n\n```python\ndef compare(user_output, expected_output):\n    return user_output == expected_output\n```\n\nThis function will return `True` if `user_output` is exactly the same as `expected_output`, and `False` otherwise.", "guess_func": "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to remove all '*' characters from the string `s` by deleting each '*' along with the smallest non-'*' character to its left.\n2. **Simplification**: To make the solution as simple as possible, we can assume that the string `s` is already in a form where removing '*' characters and their corresponding smallest non-'*' characters to the left will not change the string significantly.\n3. **Guessing the Solution**: Since the problem asks for the lexicographically smallest resulting string, and we are allowed to guess, we can assume that the simplest guess is to return the string with all '*' characters removed. If this results in an incorrect answer, we can further simplify by guessing that no solution exists.\n4. **Implementation**: We will first try to return the string with all '*' characters removed. If this doesn't work, we will return an empty string to indicate no solution exists.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\ndef guess(s):\n    # Step 1: Remove all '*' characters from the string\n    result = s.replace('*', '')\n    \n    # Step 2: Return the result. If it's not correct, we assume no solution exists.\n    return result if result else \"\"\n```\n\nThis function first removes all '*' characters from the string and returns the result. If the result is an empty string, it implies no solution exists, which aligns with the problem's requirement to prefer guessing that no solution exists.", "idx": 2149}
