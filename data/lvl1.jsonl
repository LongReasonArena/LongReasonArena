For each query, you need to find the number of plates between candles that are in the substring. A plate is considered between candles if there is at least one candle to its left and at least one candle to its right in the substring.\n\tFor example, s = \"||**||**|*\", and a query [3, 8] denotes the substring \"*||**|\". The number of plates between candles in this substring is 2, as each of the two plates has at least one candle in the substring to its left and right.\nReturn an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.", "tags": ["Array", "String", "Binary Search", "Prefix Sum"], "input": {"s": "|||*|*", "queries": [[4, 4], [5, 5], [1, 5], [3, 3], [3, 3], [3, 3], [0, 2], [3, 4], [0, 1], [4, 4], [5, 5], [3, 5], [0, 5], [4, 4], [2, 3], [5, 5], [0, 3], [5, 5], [3, 4], [5, 5], [5, 5], [3, 3], [2, 3], [5, 5], [5, 5], [1, 4], [4, 5], [1, 5], [5, 5], [4, 4], [3, 3], [4, 4], [2, 4], [0, 1], [5, 5], [2, 5], [0, 2], [0, 5], [5, 5], [5, 5], [1, 5], [5, 5], [4, 4], [3, 5], [1, 5], [0, 0], [5, 5], [5, 5], [3, 5], [4, 4], [0, 1], [3, 5], [1, 3], [5, 5], [4, 5], [3, 3], [3, 5], [3, 5], [0, 1], [4, 5], [0, 5], [4, 4], [3, 5], [2, 5], [0, 1], [2, 3], [0, 4], [1, 2], [1, 5], [4, 4], [4, 5], [0, 3], [3, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [3, 5], [4, 4], [2, 4], [0, 4], [0, 1], [4, 5], [1, 4], [4, 4], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 5], [4, 5], [1, 3], [1, 2], [5, 5], [1, 2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [5, 5], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 4], [0, 4], [5, 5], [1, 5], [5, 5], [3, 5], [2, 3], [1, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [2, 2], [5, 5], [1, 3], [3, 3], [0, 2], [2, 3], [1, 5], [2, 2], [2, 3], [3, 3], [2, 3], [2, 3], [0, 0], [4, 4], [4, 5], [0, 5], [0, 3], [4, 5], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5], [2, 2], [4, 5], [1, 1], [1, 2], [3, 3], [0, 5], [4, 5], [4, 5], [5, 5], [2, 2], [2, 2], [5, 5], [3, 3], [2, 3], [1, 4], [5, 5], [3, 4], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 4], [2, 4], [3, 3], [5, 5], [5, 5], [5, 5], [0, 2], [0, 0], [2, 5], [5, 5], [1, 5], [3, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], [0, 2], [1, 5], [5, 5], [2, 4], [4, 4], [5, 5], [3, 3], [4, 4], [1, 4], [0, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4], [3, 5], [2, 3], [0, 5], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 3], [1, 3], [2, 4], [4, 4], [3, 4], [5, 5], [5, 5], [3, 3], [3, 5], [5, 5], [4, 5], [1, 2], [1, 4], [4, 4], [1, 5], [5, 5], [1, 4], [2, 5], [4, 4], [3, 5], [3, 5], [3, 4], [1, 4], [3, 4], [3, 5], [1, 4], [1, 2], [0, 0], [4, 4], [1, 3], [1, 3], [4, 5], [2, 4], [1, 3], [4, 5], [5, 5], [2, 3], [4, 4], [2, 2], [3, 3], [5, 5], [1, 1], [3, 5], [3, 3], [5, 5], [1, 2], [0, 1], [0, 5], [5, 5], [3, 5], [5, 5], [4, 4], [5, 5], [3, 4], [2, 2], [0, 3], [5, 5], [0, 1], [2, 3], [0, 0], [2, 3], [5, 5], [0, 4], [5, 5], [3, 4], [0, 4], [3, 5], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1], [5, 5], [4, 5], [0, 2], [0, 2], [4, 4], [3, 3], [5, 5], [5, 5], [2, 3], [0, 3], [2, 4], [0, 2], [3, 3], [0, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 5], [2, 2], [0, 3], [5, 5], [3, 4], [3, 4], [5, 5], [0, 5], [2, 4], [2, 5], [1, 3], [3, 3], [1, 1], [2, 2], [4, 5], [0, 2], [2, 2], [5, 5], [2, 4], [0, 1], [0, 0], [3, 5], [0, 3], [2, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4], [1, 2], [0, 3], [5, 5], [3, 4], [2, 4], [2, 3], [2, 5], [1, 5], [3, 4], [2, 3], [4, 5], [5, 5], [0, 0], [3, 5], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 4], [5, 5], [3, 5], [2, 3], [1, 1], [3, 5], [5, 5], [1, 2], [5, 5], [5, 5], [1, 2], [1, 5], [3, 5], [5, 5], [3, 5], [1, 5], [3, 3], [2, 3], [3, 3], [4, 4], [2, 2], [4, 4], [3, 3], [4, 5], [1, 1], [1, 3], [5, 5], [1, 5], [1, 5], [5, 5], [5, 5], [5, 5], [4, 4], [5, 5], [3, 3], [3, 3], [5, 5], [4, 5], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 5], [3, 4], [2, 4], [5, 5], [4, 5], [0, 3], [1, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5], [0, 5], [2, 2], [2, 2], [5, 5], [2, 5]]}, "output": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], "input_len": 2210, "line": 1290}

{"problem": "Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome\u00a0are minimized.\nReturn the minimum number of letter changes required.\nA semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:\u200b\n\tChoose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.\n\tFor a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.\n\tThe string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.\nConsider the string \"abcabc\":\n\tThe length of \"abcabc\" is 6.
